### 1 Introduction
Java SE 7 introducted 'YYYY' as a new date pattern for identifying the week-based year.

ISO-8601 defines a week as:

In a week-based year, each week belongs to only a single year. Week 1 of a year is the first week that starts on the first day-of-week and has at least the minimum number of days. The first and last weeks of a year may contain days from the previous calendar year or next calendar year respectively.

For example, the first week of 2025 is the week from 30th December 2024 to 5th January 2025.
