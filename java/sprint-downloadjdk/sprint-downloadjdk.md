# Downloading the Oracle JDK
Duration: 5 minutes

## Introduction
There are multiple ways to download the JDK, each ideal for a different user and use-case combination.

For security reasons, only download the Oracle JDK from Oracle sources.

## Licenses
Different Java releases are made available under different licenses. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that their use of Java conforms to the applicable license.

Licenses mentioned in this workshop include:

- [Oracle No-Fee Terms and Conditions License (NFTC)](https://www.oracle.com/downloads/licenses/no-fee-license.html). All JDK Feature releases, including Long-Term Support (LTS) releases, are initially made available under this license. LTS releases convert to the OTN license (see next item) after 3 years. Non-LTS releases remain are supported for 6 months and remain on the NFTC license. See the [Oracle Java SE Support Roadmap](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html) for details.
- [Oracle Technology Network License Agreement for Oracle Java SE (OTN)](https://www.oracle.com/downloads/licenses/javase-license1.html). A free Oracle account is required to download any releases covered by OTN.
- [Oracle Binary Code License Agreement for the Java SE Platform Products and JavaFX (BCL)](https://www.oracle.com/downloads/licenses/binary-code-license.html)

## Oracle JDK Download Methods
The table below will guide you to the best download location for your needs. Use the menu on the left for detailed instructions. 

The table assumes that you know what types of releases you want, but if you would like some guidance, see [Choosing the Right JDK Version: An Unofficial Guide](https://blogs.oracle.com/java/post/choosing-the-right-jdk-version). Oracle customers can also open a Non-Technical Service Request for assistance.
