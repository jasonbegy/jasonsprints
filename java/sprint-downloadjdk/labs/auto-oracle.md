# Automatic Downloads from Oracle.com

[JDK and GraalVM Script Friendly URLs on Oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/jdk-script-friendly-urls/) has instructions for automating downloads from Oracle.com. Releases available under the NFTC license can be downloaded via command line or automatically in scripts and Dockerfiles.

It is possible to use these scripts to download both the latest and archived releases. Note that a script configured to download the latest version of a release family will cease functioning when that release family reaches end-of-life and becomes an archive release.
