# Downloading with Java Management Service on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

## Introduction

[Download Using Java Management Service on OCI](videohub:1_5oyb4ujr)

Any Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) user can download the JDK through Java Management Service (JMS).

Java Management Service can generate customized terminal commands and Dockerfiles to download the latest recent versions of releases available under the NFTC and OTN licenses.

Java Management Service tracks all of a user's downloads and can generate reports based on that data. These reporting features are mainly useful for fleet management and can be ignored if they are not useful to you.

Another advantage of using JMS is that you if you automate a download of an LTS release covered by the NFTC, and the license changes to OTN, you simply have to login to OCI and accept the new terms. Your existing download tokens will automatically be extended to the new license, which means you do not have to update any scripts.

Note that when creating an OCI account, even a free tier, Oracle will ask for a credit card number to verify your identity. Your credit card information will not be saved and you will never be automatically billed.
