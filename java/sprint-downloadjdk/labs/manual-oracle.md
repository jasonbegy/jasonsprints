[Download Manually from Oracle.com](videohub:1_pxs09t22)

Anyone can download the Oracle JDK from [the Java download page on Oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/), which has currently-supported releases covered by the NFTC and OTN licenses.

At the top of the page are the releases covered by the NFTC license, and beneath that are the releases covered by the OTN license. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that their use of Java conforms to the applicable license. GraalVM is available from this page as well.

Releases covered by the OTN license require a login with a free Oracle account.

Publicly-available end-of-life releases can be downloaded from the Java Archive page on Oracle.com. These are covered by the NFTC, OTN or BCL license, depending on the particular release.

Alternatively, anyone with an Oracle account can download any version of the JDK using [Oracle Software Delivery Cloud](https://edelivery.oracle.com/osdc/faces/Home.jspx). This system allows you to select multiple Oracle products, and then download a customized downloader. That downloader will download .zip files of the chosen packages. These are made available under Oracle Standard Terms and Restrictions.
